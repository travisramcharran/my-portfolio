# My Portfolio

## Description

This is the first draft of my web developer portfolio. Although it is bland, I will update it throughout the course. I visited a website to aid with building my portfolio, which is in the credits. 

## Installation

First I created a repository on Github called my-portfolio. 
Then used VSCode to create the index.html, style.css, and script.js files.

## Usage
I used HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap 5.

Here are screenshots:

## Credits

I used Sampurna Chapagain's tutorial on how to build my portfolio. It was very detailed and provided everything I needed. Here is the website: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-portfolio-website-using-html-css-javascript-and-bootstrap/#how-to-add-a-hero-header-to-the-portfolio
